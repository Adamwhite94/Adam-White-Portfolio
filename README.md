Hi!

This is my Eportfolio

This was made to showcase the best of the projects that I have made and tell you a bit more about myself.

The tech stack for this is:
## React
## TypeScript
## Framer - For animations
## CSS - Styled-Components

I hope you enjoy deep diving into the code that made this portfolio possible, and find that it is clean, readable and well organised!




Kind regards,
Adam White
